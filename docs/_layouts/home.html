    <h2>Tech Innovation Meets the Social Sector</h2>
  <p>
      The Early Childhood Innovation Network (ECIN) in partnership with Childrenâ€™s National Hospital and Georgetown is working to transform this and create a new national model for how communities deal with toxic stress and empower children.  Specifically, starting in Washington, D.C. the ECIN aims to be a community-wide catalyst for positive change and building resilience, enabling families and those who support them, such as pediatricians, child care providers, and social service agencies, to intervene early and prevent or decrease the influences of these toxic stresses so that children can reach their fullest potential.
